## Introduction

This **Feed Reader App** gathers rss feeds. The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) was created by Udacity for a course project assessment.  The objective of this project from the student perspective was to write unit tests, against the feed reader app, utilising the Jasmine test framework.


## App specifics

In normal operation. The feed reader should display a list of feeds from the defined list of source URLs contained in the `allFeeds` array, within the `app.js` file. The different feeds are then selectable from the menu within the app.

At the bottom of the browser screen, the Jasmine Test Framework will display the results of the unit tests that are contained within the `feedreader.js` file. These ensure that all is well with the **Feed Reader App**.
All tests should show green status, if all is well. When the project is complete, there are 7 tests configured or 'specs', as shown by Jasmine.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure:
1. That your device is connected to the internet, as several elements are retrieved from there.
2. That you have an up to date version installed _(date of writing 06-08-19)_ of any modern web browser for your device e.g. such as _Chrome, Firefox, Safari._
3. That you have extracted all the files in the .zip or from the github repository, into a single folder on your device.
4. Then just open the `index.html` file.
